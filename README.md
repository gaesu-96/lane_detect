This project is built on ROS2 and Gazebo and is divided into two categories. One category utilizes a computer vision algorithm instead of deep learning.

It detects lanes using the Hough Transform and controls the vehicle using a PID controller.

The other category employs deep learning techniques for segmentation.

While not yet perfect, the system successfully demonstrates lane detection and straight-line driving capabilities.
