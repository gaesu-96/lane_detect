This project is built on ROS2 and Gazebo, utilizing a computer vision algorithm instead of deep learning.
It detects lanes using the Hough Transform and controls the vehicle using a PID controller.
While not yet perfect, the system successfully demonstrates lane detection and straight-line driving capabilities.
